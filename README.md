Introduction

Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR) is a fundamental problem in the field of pattern recognition and computer vision. It involves the automatic identification and classification of handwritten characters from images. With the increasing digitization of documents and forms, HCR systems play a vital role in various applications such as postal address reading, bank check processing, digitizing historical documents, and form data entry.
Machine Learning (ML) techniques, especially with the advent of deep learning, have significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of HCR systems. By training models on large datasets of labeled handwritten characters, ML algorithms can learn to recognize diverse handwriting styles and generalize well to unseen samples.
